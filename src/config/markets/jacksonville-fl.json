  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Will I get a lowball offer?",
      "answer": "We don't do that. Here's what most sellers miss: when you sell through an agent, you lose 6% in commissions, 2% in closing costs, and often $10K–$30K in repairs just to get the house 'show ready.' Our offer is a NET number — what you see is what you walk away with. Zero commissions, zero closing costs, zero repair bills. When you compare apples to apples, our offers are competitive."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this a scam? How do I know you're legit?",
      "answer": "Fair question — a lot of 'we buy houses' people are sketchy. We're local Jacksonville investors with a real office at 1847 King St. We use standard Florida contracts and close at a reputable local title company where your funds are protected by a neutral third party. You can look us up, visit us, and verify everything before you sign anything."
    },
    {
      "question": "How fast can you actually close?",
      "answer": "As fast as 7 days if you need it. The average home listed with an agent in Jacksonville sits on the market for 52 days — and that's before inspections, appraisals, and buyer financing delays that can add weeks or kill the deal entirely. We pay cash, so there's no lender involved. You pick the date, we show up with the funds."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to clean or make repairs?",
      "answer": "No. We buy homes in any condition — hoarder situations, fire damage, foundation issues, 30-year-old kitchens, you name it. Leave whatever you don't want. We handle everything after closing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I owe more than the house is worth?",
      "answer": "We can still help. We work with lenders on short sales and have experience navigating these situations. Even if the numbers are tight, it's worth a conversation — we may be able to structure something that gets you out from under the debt without a foreclosure on your record."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there any obligation if I fill out the form?",
      "answer": "None. You'll get a cash offer, and you can take it or leave it. No pressure, no follow-up calls you didn't ask for, no contracts to sign until you're ready. We'd rather earn your trust than push a deal."
