## Page CRO Framework

### The Hierarchy of Conversion Elements

Score every page against these elements, in priority order:

1. **Hero Section (Above the Fold)**
   - Clear, benefit-driven headline (not clever — CLEAR)
   - Subheadline that explains what you do and for whom
   - Primary CTA visible without scrolling
   - Trust signal (reviews count, years in business, or "No obligation")
   - On mobile: phone number and CTA must be thumb-reachable

2. **Value Proposition**
   - Answer: "Why should I choose YOU over the other guy?"
   - 3-4 bullet points max, each starting with a benefit
   - Use specifics, not generics: "Cash offer in 24 hours" beats "Fast service"

3. **Social Proof**
   - Reviews/testimonials near the CTA (not buried at bottom)
   - Include name, location, situation: "Sarah M., Jacksonville — Foreclosure"
   - Star ratings if available
   - Count: "500+ homes purchased" or similar volume signal

4. **Form/Contact**
   - Multi-step forms outperform single long forms by 86%
   - Start with the easiest field (address) not the scariest (phone number)
   - Progress indicator on multi-step forms
   - Phone number field should be prominent on the final step
   - SMS consent checkbox (unchecked by default — legally required)

5. **Objection Handling**
   - FAQ section addressing top 3-5 concerns
   - "No fees, no commissions, no obligation" messaging
   - Process explanation (How It Works in 3 steps)

6. **Sticky Elements**
   - Sticky call bar on mobile (this alone can 2x conversions)
   - Sticky CTA button that follows scroll
   - Click-to-call must be one tap on mobile

## Copywriting Principles for Motivated Sellers

### Voice & Tone
- **Empathetic**, not salesy. These people are stressed.
- **Direct**, not clever. Say what you mean.
- **Confident**, not aggressive. "We buy houses" not "WE'LL BUY YOUR HOUSE!!!"
- **Local**, not generic. Reference the city, neighborhoods, local details.

### Headline Formulas That Convert

**Problem-Solution:**
"Facing Foreclosure in Jacksonville? Get a Cash Offer in 24 Hours"

**Direct Benefit:**
"Sell Your Jacksonville Home Fast — No Repairs, No Fees, No Hassle"

**Question:**
"Need to Sell Your House in Jacksonville? We Pay Cash and Close Fast"

### Words That Work for Motivated Sellers
- Cash offer
- Close fast / close in days
- No repairs needed
- No fees, no commissions
- As-is condition
- Fair price
- Confidential / discreet
- No obligation
- Free consultation
- We handle the paperwork

### Words to AVOID
- "We buy ugly houses" (insulting to the homeowner)
- "Desperate" or "distressed" (never describe the PERSON this way)
- "Below market value" (even if true, never lead with it)
- "Investor" (sounds predatory — use "home buyer" or "local buyer")

## Form Optimization

### Multi-Step Form Structure (Proven High-Conversion)

**Step 1: Address** (lowest friction, starts the commitment)
- "What's the property address?"
- Auto-complete with Google Places API
- Auto-advance on selection

**Step 2: Situation** (builds context, segment the lead)
- "What's your situation?" with clickable options:
  - Foreclosure, Inherited Property, Divorce, Relocating, Tired Landlord, Behind on Payments, Other
- Auto-advance on selection

**Step 3: Timeline** (qualifies urgency)
- "How soon do you need to sell?"
  - ASAP, Within 30 days, 1-3 months, Just exploring
- Auto-advance on selection

**Step 4: Contact** (highest friction — comes LAST)
- Phone number (primary — large field)
- Name
- Email (optional — don't gate on this)
- SMS consent checkbox (unchecked, with legal text)
- Submit button: "Get My Cash Offer" (not "Submit")

### KPI Targets per Step
- Step 1 → Step 2: 80%+ continuation
- Step 2 → Step 3: 85%+ continuation
- Step 3 → Step 4: 70%+ continuation
- Step 4 completion: 60%+

## Mobile-First Rules

1. **Tap targets: minimum 48px** — fingers are not mouse pointers
2. **Phone number: click-to-call** — `<a href="tel:+1XXXXXXXXXX">`
3. **Form fields: full-width** — no side-by-side fields on mobile
4. **Sticky call bar**: Fixed bottom bar with phone icon + "Call Now" button
5. **Thumb zone**: Primary CTAs in the bottom 40% of screen
6. **Font size: 16px minimum** body text (prevents iOS zoom on focus)
7. **No horizontal scroll** — test on 320px width

4. What happens next (3 steps)
5. Phone number to call if they can't wait
